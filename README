I'm trying...

...to manage BLOBs between MySQL and PostgreSQL in a JTA transaction.

I'm trying Atomikos. I'm following all these tutorials:

· http://blog.springsource.org/2011/08/15/configuring-spring-and-jta-without-full-java-ee/
· http://blog.9mmedia.com/?p=489
· http://it-essence.xs4all.nl/roller/technology/entry/transactions_over_multiple_jpa_persistence
· http://www.atomikos.com/Documentation/SpringIntegration

The environment: 

· Spring 3.1
· Hibernate 3.6.8
· Atomikos 3.7.0

But it doesn't work :(

WARNING: edit database.properties with the appropriate username/password values.

There are 3 Entities:

- Document: which table is in MySQL.

All its tests run successfully.

- Documento: which table is in PostgreSQL.

It doesn't work: Caused by: org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: Large Objects may not be used in auto-commit mode.

If the transactions had worked, it would have been passed the tests.

So, I presume there's a problem with Atomikos and PostgreSQL, as you can read here:

http://www.atomikos.com/Documentation/KnownProblems#Postgresql_Limited_XA_Support

You can see an example of an execution in console.txt
